A design system is never finished. That’s why we invite all designers, developers, and writers from across the world to help improve WPDS. It’s easy to get started.

### **Get connected**

In order to stay up to date on all things design systems at WordPress, join the #design-systems channel on Slack.
It’s a great place to ask what could be your first contribution, and we’ll be happy to help you make it happen.

Also feel free to ask questions, join discussions, or just read along.

For anything specific to the code implementation of UI components (and the @wordpress/components package), join the #components channel.

### **Get ready to contribute**

There are a couple of steps before you can start contributing to the design system. You’ll need access to GitHub, for example, where all contributions to our design system are started, followed, and finished.

In the spirit of Automattic, we apply a public-first mentality to our design system, WordPress, and Gutenberg.

The majority of conversations should happen on GitHub in the open — just make sure not to share Automattic-specific information. Slack should only be used for day-to-day coordination and when discussing matters private to Automattic.
